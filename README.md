# This repository provides the complete source code for reproducing the results in the manuscript: "Locally Constrained Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Data Clustering".
To reproduce the experiment, simply open MATLAB (Version>=R2019b), set the repository folder as the working directory, and run clear all; clc; main;. No additional configuration is required. Once executed, the script automatically loads COIL100_Obj.mat (Loading other datasets can be modified in the main function), normalizes the feature vectors using Euclidean length, randomly selects 10% of labeled samples (LabelsRatio=0.1), and performs clustering using both the proposed LCNMF method and LCNMF-div. The experiment is run 20 times to ensure stability, after which the program records and outputs the mean Accuracy and Mutual Information across all runs, printing the results in the MATLAB console while simultaneously storing key variables within the workspace.
