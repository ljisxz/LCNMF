Locally constrained non-negative matrix factorization for data clustering
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Semi-supervised Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) has attracted considerable attention for clustering tasks involving high-dimensional data, since incorporating partial supervision can notably improve clustering accuracy. Nevertheless, existing semi-supervised NMF variants often face challenges related to hyperparameter selection and are incapable of generating cluster labels directly. To overcome these limitations, we present a new approach called Locally Constrained NMF (LCNMF). This method integrates limited label information into the NMF framework by constraining specific local elements in the low-dimensional representation of labeled samples to be zero. The proposed LCNMF is free of hyperparameters, and it unifies dimensionality reduction and clustering into a single framework, enabling direct derivation of cluster assignments. We further investigate two formulations of the LCNMF objective function and develop corresponding optimization procedures. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LCNMF outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of clustering performance.
